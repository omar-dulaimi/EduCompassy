 ## Problem ##
 > Nowadays , we strated to notice a gab between parents and children , because  both of parents are working and don't have time to go to the school and ask about their children ,eventhough  most of the time the don't have time to attend any events in the school,  and most of the time they back to the home tired so they don't even open their  childern's bags to know what their homework ,so this is  the common problem that parents force .

## Solution ##
 > Our project find a solution to every parents who are suffring from this problem , they can connect with school staffs from any part of the world while they are travelling and know every thing about their children , in this application they will have their own page that help them to connect with teachers and admins immediately  and see every thing related to their childrenlike their homework and events and marks and weekly reports  .
